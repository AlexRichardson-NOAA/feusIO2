Description: This package consists of three functions that work together to process catch data into economic impacts. 
Note that they require input files not included here - contact Alex Richardson <alex.richardson@noaa.gov> to
request inputs. io_classifier() sorts catch data into species-level categories using Emily Markowitz's FishEconProdOutput
package, io_calculator() applies classified catch data to a series of multipliers in order to obtain impacts, and
io_cleaner() displays impacts data in a variety of formats.
